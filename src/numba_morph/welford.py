    Calculate mean and standard deviation of a Numpy array using the Welford algorithm.
    Much more memory efficient for getting the standard deviation.

    Args:
        arr (np.ndarray): Input array.
        where (np.ndarray, optional): Boolean array of the same shape as `arr` indicating
                                      which elements to include. Defaults to None (include all).

    Returns:
        tuple: (mean, std) as float64 values. Returns (nan, nan) if no elements are included.
